										<p>Hey guys, I'll be honest introductions really aren't my thing but since you've taken the time to found more about me, I'll give you the courtesy.</p>
										<p>Well I'm Evan Lee and I'm currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science / Science going into my 4th year next year and yeah you've probably figured by now that I'm running for CSESoc President and Secretary 2022.</p>
										<p>If you really want to know more about me, there's some stuff later though I'm not sure why you would want to.</p>

								<h2>My Vision</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I guess I should at least mention that it goes without saying that I'll do my very best to uphold the expectations of any President or representative of CSESoc:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Listen to and serve the CSE community</li>
								<li>Strive to improve the experiences within the CSE community</li>
								<li>Act as representative of CSESoc and fulfil my duties</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Without boring you guys, my vision is pretty simple and there a few things that I really want to focus on and aim to achieve:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Help ease university life for all CSE students, and have bit of fun :)</li>
								<li>Facilitate more diverse relationships with other socities and faculties</li>
								<li>Build lasting bonds both within and outside the CSE community</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Oh and I'm not gonna lie but I reckon it'll be an amazing experience and I would love to have bit of fun before I leave the university life behind.</p>

						Thanks for checking out my campaign! If you believe in me to not completely mess it up then yeah I guess throw me a vote? So this is where you can skip
						if you're not bothered but if you're weird enough to care then you can read a little more about me, still not sure why you would.

						<h3>Camp</h3>

							<div class="col-4">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/camp2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<div class="col-8">
								<p>
									Ever since attending First Year Camp as a campee in 2019, I have gone back every year and helped out as both a camp leader and organiser.
									I honestly think that it can be one of the funnest experiences you
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-8">
								<p>
									can have going into university as you meet many like minded people that you are probably gonna see around for the next three years or so
									and you can actually make some really long lasting friendships.

					<h3>Peer Mentoring</h3>
						<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-50">
							<div class="col-7">
								<p>
									Much like first year camp, peer mentoring is something you definitely should do as you come into university cause it really helps ease
									the transition from high school to university. It is different as it is a much more
								</p>

							<div class="col-5">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pm1.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pm2.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>
									interactive experience and you have more time to develop lasting bonds. Asides from that, you get a constant stream of support from both
									experienced mentors and peers going through the same thing.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<h3>Hobbies</h3>
					<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-50">
						<div class="col-4">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/camp3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						</div>
						<div class="col-8">
							<p>
								Asides from university life, you'll probably find me chilling out and having fun with my hobbies in my free time. While I do love computer
								science and coding, sometimes I too need a break and usually I love to game and do sports.
							</p>
							<p>
								I mainly PC game with my most played (not favourite) games being League of Legends (horrible game),
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-8">
							<p>
								CSGO, Valorant, Beat Saber, and a bunch of others, also special mention to Overwatch my favourite game that's dead.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also play a lot of different sports with my favourite being football, basketball, and volleyball. I've also hurt myself quite a few times
								trying to skate, trick and parkour which you can find on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/for_fun_player/">Instagram</a>.

					<h3>Small Flex</h3>
					<div class="row gtr-uniform gtr-50">
						<p>
							Upon becoming a Peer Mentor in 2020, I helped revamp the structure and create a much more engaging experience particularly with the challenges of
							lockdown. Since then, a few peer mentoring programs have incorporated some of my ideas.
						</p>
						<p>
							As Socials Director of 2021, I helped improve event exposure significantly like having all camp tickets sell out in 3 DAYS and pubcrawl tickets sell
							out in 10 MINUTES! Our collaboration with other societies increased threefold. And, every single event that we run was at maximum capacity!
